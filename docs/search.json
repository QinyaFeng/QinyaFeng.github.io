This research employs three distinct natural experiments and considers genetic factors to triangulate this relationship: Study 1 analyses discordant monozygotic twins; Study 2 assesses the impact of a Swedish education reform; and Study 3 analyses dizygotic twins with the use of a polygenic index for education, a DNA-based measure for genetic predispositions toward education. The results indicate that education does modestly promote open views toward immigration (Study 1), yet the reform’s effect remains uncertain (Study 2). Study 3 offers direct evidence of the effects of genetic predispositions and suggests that genetics related to education may influence attitudes beyond achieved educational attainment. These findings confirm the positive impact of education while pointing to the combined influence of genetic and social pathways in shaping immigration attitudes.\n“Although Study 2 on the reform may be underpowered thus compromising the result comparison between the reform and MZ-twin studies, contrasting the significant effects observed in the MZ-twin study with the null effect of high school and university in longitudinal studies with adolescents and young adults suggests that education may have more political significance in midlife. This implies that theories concerning long-term downstream mechanisms, such as “education-as-cleavage” and educational disparities in receptivity to elite messaging (Cavaille and Marshall, 2019, p. 262), may be more plausible.”\n\n \n\n\n\n2018-2019 Msc in Public Policy, University College London\n2014-2018 Bsc in Public Administration (Land Resource Management), Nanjing Agricultural University"
